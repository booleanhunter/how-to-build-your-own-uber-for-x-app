 ## To do

- Mimic a moving cop and a moving civilian that continuously send location updates to each other in real time, and update the marker icons on the map.
- Set the status field to closed once the cop has helped the civilian out. Then, you can assign a different colour to visualize closed issues on a heat-map. That way you‚Äôll have an understanding of how efficient cops are in a given area.
- Build a rating system with which a civilian and a cop can rate each other. This way, neither civilian nor cop will misuse the system, and cops can get performance reports.
- Have a cool looking user interface, like Material UI.
- Lastly, have a sign-up and login mechanism!
